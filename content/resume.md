Hi! I'm Rajiv ðŸ‘‹

I have been working for over nineteen years across utilities, finance, construction, automobile and telecom domains and have played diverse business and technical roles ranging from hands-on development to helping our clients elucidate new requirements, building proof-of-concept pieces and analyse their impact on existing applications. 
I have also been responsible for design, infrastructure and performance on my projects.
